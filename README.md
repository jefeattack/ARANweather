# ARANweather

These files were in preparation for a ML model using Iowa State University's ARAN rural wireless network. Multiple sensors on the network have the ability to take detailed readings of weather and power parameters. The concept was to pull these readings and feed them to a ML model baselining optimal conditions. This work is mine and all code has been developed by me, the data is derived from IAState equipment and software.


wx_pwr.json is an example of the weather data pulled from Wilson Hall.
wx_pwr.py is the method to automate the data pulls.
wx_pwrtest.json is the end result of the aggregated data set.
